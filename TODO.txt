- Free List
	- list with no merging (first)
		- LIFO may want to change to ordered
	- free list with merging
		- Prototype functions written
	- Segregated storage
- free() function
	- mark it as free
		- Done may have errors
	- merge with adjacent blocks (todo after free list is working)
		- Prototype functions written, see TODO statements
- malloc()
	- look through list to find a suitable size block
	- if not make a new block of memory by incrementing heap pointer
- realloc()
	- extend data
	- if a block is free next to it extend
	- if not find a free block of big enough size
	- if not remove from current block and create a new block
- heap consistency checker
	- make sure blocks are actually free
	- make sure blocks are merged correctly
	- check to see if allocated blocks are overlaped
	- make sure we have valid heap addresses

- Notes
	- users only care about the address of payload should know nothing about blocks
